Hi, im a 10 year old coder. 
I was self tought and a little bit of help from ny dad.
I had an old Github account (It diddnt go so great).
I know Js, Html, Css, and learning Python.

My socials:
Scratch- ProGithubCoder
Reddit- Spooky_Ghost_Blooket

What i like:
Playing Blooket
Coding on scratch
Playing Gorilla Tag
Coding
Making Websites

How i started:
I used to play Prodigy (you may not know it) and i loved computers, My freind started asking me if i could make hacks for it, me being 8 i knew NOTHING about coding so i
started looking into it and i made my forst prodigy hack.
